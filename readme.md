This project is done entirely by me(Soumesh Padhi 21BCE0920) to the best of my efforts. This project aimed at solving the following problems
ðŸ“Œ PART 1: NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN & SETUP
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Enterprise-Grade Network Topology:

Design a multi-layered network with core, distribution, and access layers.
Implement redundant network paths using OSPF/BGP with automatic failover.
Firewall & Load Balancing:

Configure Palo Alto, Cisco ASA, or pfSense firewall for intrusion detection & prevention (IDS/IPS).
Deploy NGINX or HAProxy for load balancing web traffic across multiple servers.
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) & VPN Configuration:

Set up AWS/GCP/Azure VPC with subnets, NAT gateways, and security groups.
Implement site-to-site VPN with IPsec for secure remote access.
ðŸ“Œ PART 2: HIGH-AVAILABILITY & SELF-HEALING SYSTEM
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Automated Failover & Disaster Recovery:

Deploy active-active failover using Keepalived or VRRP.
Implement Geo-Distributed DNS Failover with Cloudflare or Route 53.
Self-Healing Infrastructure:

Configure Ansible/Puppet to detect & restart failed services automatically.
Use Prometheus/Grafana alerts to trigger self-healing scripts.
Zero-Downtime OS & Network Updates:

Implement Live Patching (Canonical Livepatch, Ksplice).
Deploy Rolling Updates using Kubernetes Cluster Networking (Flannel, Cilium).
ðŸ“Œ PART 3: AUTOMATED NETWORK MONITORING & SECURITY
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Real-Time Network Monitoring:

Deploy Zabbix, Nagios, or Prometheus for SNMP-based network health monitoring.
Configure NetFlow/sFlow for real-time traffic analysis.
Automated Intrusion Detection & Response (IDR):

Deploy Suricata or Snort for network traffic anomaly detection.
Configure fail2ban to block repeated SSH & web attacks automatically.
SIEM & Log Aggregation:

Centralize logs with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk.
Implement real-time threat detection & alerting for anomalies.
ðŸ“Œ PART 4: NETWORK AUTOMATION & CI/CD FOR INFRASTRUCTURE
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Automated Infrastructure Deployment:

Use Terraform to provision network resources in AWS/GCP/Azure.
Automate firewall rules & VLAN configuration using Ansible.
Continuous Compliance & Auditing:

Implement OpenSCAP or CIS Benchmark scans for security compliance.
Set up GitOps-style network configuration management using ArgoCD.
Load & Stress Testing:

Simulate 1M+ concurrent connections using Locust, Apache JMeter, or Tsung.
Ensure zero packet loss under heavy traffic conditions.
ðŸ“Œ PART 5: ENTERPRISE-GRADE BACKUP & DATA PROTECTION
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Automated Backups & Disaster Recovery (DR):

Implement incremental & full backups using Bacula, Veeam, or Duplicity.
Test bare-metal restores & VM failover procedures.
Data Encryption & Access Control:

Encrypt all sensitive data using AES-256 & TLS 1.3.
Implement Zero Trust Security Model (ZTNA) for remote access.
ðŸ“Œ PART 6: ADVANCED CHALLENGES (BONUS POINTS)
ðŸ”¥ Optional but highly recommended tasks:
âœ… AI-Based Anomaly Detection: Deploy ML-powered network security using Zeek or TensorFlow.
âœ… Blockchain for Network Logs: Store network logs on a tamper-proof blockchain ledger.
âœ… Post-Quantum Cryptography: Test post-quantum VPN encryption (Kyber, Dilithium).
